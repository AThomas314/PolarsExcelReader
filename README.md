Working on creating a native read_excel function for rust polars here like there is in python polars. Hope to contribute this to the actual polars crate soon.
It's also my first Rust project though so there may be many things lacking lol


Done now -> read into dataframe from single/multiple sheets. 
next step -> Type inference
